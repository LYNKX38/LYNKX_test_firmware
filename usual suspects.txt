 because cannot erase first 
 because FLASH_WaitForLastOperation fails
 because  FLASH->SR = 0xE0 (PGSERR SIZERR PGAERR) should be 0
 because DMA transfer from flash to DAC causes errors on SR register even if sound is OK

 Temporary solution: clear Flash errors flags afer playing sound
     __HAL_FLASH_CLEAR_FLAG(FLASH_FLAG_SR_ERRORS);
